    <h2 class="home-head">Welcome!</h2>
    <article class="home-p">
        Welcome to my website where I will help you organize all
        the parts that you want to build in your new pc
        <br>
        I am not only here to organize your part but also to
        provide resources on the different specifications that you want
        need to know about to start building a pc
        <br>
        <h2>"I dont know anything,Where to Start?"</h2>

        If you are building a pc for the first and you know nothing
        about anything, don't worry, it's (mostly) simpler
        then it seems
        <br>
        Firstly, what parts will you need to build a pc in
        the first place, and What do you need
        to build a pc is as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>CPU</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cpu Cooler</li>
                <li>Thermal Paste</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>RAM [Memory]</li>
            <li>Storage</li>
            <li>GPU [Graphics Card]</li>
            <ul>
                <li>GPU Sag Bracket </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Case</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Case Fans</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Power Supply [PSU]</li>
            <li>Moniter</li>
        </ul>
        This may look like a long list of things but as you 
        learn more it will be simpler and easier to understand.
