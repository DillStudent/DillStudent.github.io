    <h1>How to pick the right right parts?</h1>

    <h2>Cpu</h2>
    <br>
    The CPU is responsible for executing instructions that your programs and operating system give it.
    It’s in charge of logic, calculations, and decision-making.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Important Deatils:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Count:</strong>Cores are like mini-brains inside the CPU that let it do multiple tasks at
                once. More cores = better multitasking.</li>
            <li><strong>Clock Speed: This shows how fast the CPU can perform tasks. A higher clock speed means the CPU
                    can process things quicker.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>If you’re building a PC for:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gaming:</strong>You don't need a crazy amount of cores. A fast clock speed is more important.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Video editing, 3D rendering, streaming, large data processing:</strong> You’ll benefit from a
                CPU with more cores and high clock speeds, because these programs can use many cores at once.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Brands:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intel: </strong>Known for strong single-core performance, good for gaming.</li>
            <li><strong>AMD: </strong>Known for strong multi-core performance, better for multitasking and often a
                better value for money.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>


    <h3>CPU Cooler</h3>
    CPUs get very hot while working, so they need something to cool them down. That’s what a CPU cooler does.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air Coolers:</strong> A big metal block (called a heatsink) sits on top of the CPU with a fan that
            blows heat away. Air coolers are simple, reliable, and easier for first-timers.</li>
        <li><Strong>Liquid Coolers (AIOs):</Strong> These use water (in tubes) to move heat away from the CPU to a
            radiator, where it’s cooled by fans. They look cooler and can cool better, but they’re more
            expensive and a bit trickier to install.</li>

        <strong>Thermal Paste:</strong> <br>
        Before you mount the cooler, you need a little "gel" called thermal paste between the CPU and the cooler.
        It helps transfer heat more efficiently from the CPU to the cooler.
        <br>
        Some CPU's come with cpu coolers with preapplied thermal paste, if you area beginner it could be worth buying
        such cpus for the sake of ease

    <h3>RAM [MEMORY]</h3>
    RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It’s the short-term memory that your computer uses to quickly pull up
    information it needs right now.
    When you open programs, games, or files, they load into RAM so the CPU can access them quickly without going back to
    slower storage like a hard drive.

    <strong>What size is right?</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>16gb is usually enouigh for mlst people and basic use but ith teh ay that RAM is sold today it is very easy
            to get you hands pon 32GB which will definitely be enough </li>
        <li>You shoudl also buy <strong>DDR5 RAM</strong>, DDr5 is just the latest and fastest generation of ram</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
    The motherboard is the big board that everything plugs into.
    It connects the CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, and all other parts together so they can communicate.
    <br>
    <strong>[IMPORTANT] Socket Type</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>It is important that you CPU is compatible with your mother board, if you have an AMD CPU you need an AMD
            compatible Motherboard, the same with intel.
            and that your motherboard and cpu is compatible with your ram
        </li>
    </ul
