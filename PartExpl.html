        This is an explanation of every part that you would need to buy to complete a Pc build with a light desciption
        of each part
        <br>

        <h2>Cpu</h2>
        
        <img class="pc-img" src="Cpu.jpeg" alt="cpu">
<br>
        The CPU is responsible for executing instructions that your programs and operating system give it.
        It’s in charge of logic, calculations, and decision-making.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Important Deatils:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Count:</strong>Cores are like mini-brains inside the CPU that let it do multiple tasks
                    at
                    once. More cores = better multitasking.</li>
                <li><strong>Clock Speed: This shows how fast the CPU can perform tasks. A higher clock speed means the
                        CPU
                        can process things quicker.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>If you’re building a PC for:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gaming:</strong>You don't need a crazy amount of cores. A fast clock speed is more
                    important.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Video editing, 3D rendering, streaming, large data processing:</strong> You’ll benefit from
                    a
                    CPU with more cores and high clock speeds, because these programs can use many cores at once.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Brands:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intel: </strong>Known for strong single-core performance, good for gaming.</li>
                <li><strong>AMD: </strong>Known for strong multi-core performance, better for multitasking and often a
                    better value for money.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h3>CPU Cooler</h3>
        CPUs get very hot while working, so they need something to cool them down. That’s what a CPU cooler does.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air Coolers:</strong>
                A big metal block (called a heatsink) sits on top of the CPU with a fan
                that blows heat away. Air coolers are simple, reliable, and easier for first-timers.</li>
            <li><Strong>Liquid Coolers (AIOs):</Strong>
                These use water (in tubes) to move heat away from the CPU to a
                radiator, where it’s cooled by fans. They look cooler and can cool better, but they’re more
                expensive and a bit trickier to install.</li>

            <li><strong>Thermal Paste:</strong>
                Before you mount the cooler, you need a little "gel" called thermal paste between the CPU and the
                cooler.
                It helps transfer heat more efficiently from the CPU to the cooler.</li>
            <br>
            Some CPU's come with cpu coolers with preapplied thermal paste, if you area beginner it could be worth
            buying
            such cpus for the sake of ease

        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>RAM [MEMORY]</h3>
        RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It’s the short-term memory that your computer uses to quickly pull up
        information it needs right now.
        When you open programs, games, or files, they load into RAM so the CPU can access them quickly without going
        back to
        slower storage like a hard drive.

        <strong>What size is right?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>16gb is usually enouigh for mlst people and basic use but ith teh ay that RAM is sold today it is very
                easy
                to get you hands pon 32GB which will definitely be enough </li>
            <li>You shoudl also buy <strong>DDR5 RAM</strong>, DDr5 is just the latest and fastest generation of ram
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        The motherboard is the big board that everything plugs into.
        It connects the CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, and all other parts together so they can communicate.
        <br>
        <strong>[IMPORTANT] Socket Type</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>It is important that you CPU is compatible with your mother board, if you have an AMD CPU you need an
                AMD
                compatible Motherboard, the same with intel.
                and that your motherboard and cpu is compatible with your ram.
            </li>
        </ul>


        Form Factor

        <ul>

            <li>E-ATX [Bigger, not recomened for beginners]</li>
            <br>
            E-ATX motherboards are larger than standard ATX and designed for
            high-end builds with lots of features—such as extra PCIe slots, more RAM
            capacity, and multiple GPU support.
            <li>ATX [regular size, recomended for beginners]</li>
            <br>
            The most common size, offering a good balance of expandability and compatibility.
            Supports several PCIe slots and typically 4 RAM slots.
            <li>Micro-ATX [Smaller]</li>
            <br>
            A smaller version of ATX with fewer expansion slots. Still capable of gaming and multitasking,
            just with less expandability.
            <li>Micro-ITX [Very Small, not recomened for beginners]</li>
            <br>
            Very compact and designed for space-saving builds. Limited expansion options (usually one PCIe slot
            and 2 RAM slots). Challenging for cable management and cooling.
        </ul>

        <h3>Storage</h3>

        Storage is where all your games, apps, photos, and documents are saved permanently.
        <br>
        <strong>Types of storage</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive [HDD]</strong></li>
                 <br>
                Older, mechanical drives. Large capacity and cheaper ($). Slower loading speeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Solid State Drive [SSD]</strong></li>
                <br> 
                No moving parts, way faster than HDDs. Programs load much faster, and your
                whole PC feels quicker.
            <ul>
                
                <ul><li><strong>Types of SSDs</strong></li></ul>
                <li>SATA SSD:
                    An older, slower type of SSD. Still way faster than an HDD.</li>
                <li>NVMe SSD (M.2 Form Factor):
                    Tiny, stick-like drives that plug directly into the motherboard. Extremely fast.</li>
           
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3> GPU [Graphics Card]</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Important Information</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VRAM (Video RAM):</strong>More VRAM helps handle higher resolutions and larger textures.
                    (6GB is okay for 1080p gaming; 8GB+ is better for 1440p and up.)</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Tier:</strong> Pick your GPU based on the games or work you’ll be doing.
                    (Example: RTX 4060 for 1080p gaming, RTX 4070/4070 Ti for 1440p or higher.)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ray Tracing:</strong> Fancy lighting effects in games — looks amazing but requires strong
                    GPUs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Upscaling Tech (DLSS, FSR):</strong>Helps boost frame rates while keeping image quality
                    high.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>First-time building advice</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t bottleneck your system by getting a super powerful GPU and a weak CPU (or vice versa).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Power Supply [PSU]</h3>
        The PSU provides power to every component of your PC.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Important Deatils:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wattage:</strong> Make sure your PSU has enough power for your parts (600W–850W is common
                    for
                    gaming builds).</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Rating:</strong>80+ Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum — Higher is better (more
                    efficient, less wasted power).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Modularity:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fully Modular: </strong>You plug in only the cables you need (neater).</li>
                <li><strong>Semi-Modular:</strong>Some cables attached, others optional.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Modular: </strong>All cables attached (messier, cheaper).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Case</h3>
        The case is essentially teh box that you put everything in and usually pc cases are designed in a way that
        promotes
        airflow so youncan properly cool all your parts
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Important Deatils:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>size</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Atx:</strong> The normal size that is recomended for beginners</li>
                <li><strong>Micro-Atx: smaller then normal but still enough spcae for it to be comfortable for new
                        builders</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Itx: </strong>Very small but difficult for new builde, not recomended</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>First-time building advice</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Alot of cases come with pre installed fans, it would be worth getting such cases for you first buidl
                </li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Moniter</h3>
        The monitor is what shows you the results of all your computer’s work.
        It displays games, movies, web browsing, and everything else you do.
        Choosing a good monitor makes a huge difference in how great your PC feels.

        Important Deatils
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resolution::</strong></li>
            <ul>
